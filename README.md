            note:
                 this playlist is not a "neural network bot" but read the tag "IDEA FROM"

function:
- chat
- open certain website
- open certain
- idk like greet and understand you
- i had no-one who understood me :')
- store passwords
- do '.config' to open settings
- you can also change the name of the bot in .config (to access the config file type .config --reader to read and .config --change to change)


note:
    you can see many file, eg: credientials.py or open_browser.py
    they are sort-of cogs like in discord bots to not to make a file heavy so yeah

another note:
    sorry if i spelled credientials wrong, i ai'nt DELIUM lol

last note:
    Delium is my bot's name :)
